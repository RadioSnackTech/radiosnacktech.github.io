## Space

In January 2026, Radio Snack moved into a new space at [916 Rue Ontario E, #130](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PpCGADvddT2V7wQh9)!

Our new space has two rooms, a public and a private studio. The public studio
will be available for members to share space, use tools, co-work and more! If
you want your own dedicated studio, we've got the private space as well! Both
are well-light, spacious, and full of possibilities.

Here's the private space:
