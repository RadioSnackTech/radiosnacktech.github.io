## Space

In January 2026, Radio Snack moved into a new space at
[916 Rue Ontario E, #130](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PpCGADvddT2V7wQh9)!


Our new space has two rooms, a **community space** and a **private studio**.
Both are well-lit, spacious, and full of possibilities. We're on the ground
floor, there are around 8 steps to get in.


**The community space** is open to Radio Snack members to share space, use
tools, co-work and more! It’s also where we host our [public events](/events).
It has a Bambu 3D printer, risograph printer, soldering station, drill press,
sewing machine, a laser cutter, fast wifi, a printer, kitchenette, and lots
of tea.

**The private studio** is rented by a small group of artists and community
members who need permanent workstations in a shared private room. We have a few
spots available.

We occasionally host open houses or other free events where you can meet
everyone and check out the space, [join our mailing list](https://mailchi.mp/5900d5de779a/follow-radio-snack) to learn more.
