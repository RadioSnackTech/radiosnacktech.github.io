  "description": "Our 3D printer’s name is Dumpling (aka Hot Dumps)! It is a Bambu P1S with optional AMS system. The slicer for it is called BambuStudio, and you can download it yourself, or use BambuStudio on the RadioSnack computers  Specs: Build volume : 256mmx25mmx256mm Nozzle: 0.4 mm Stainless Steel  Supported Filaments:  Ideal: PLA, PETG, TPU, PVA, PET, ABS, ASA Capable: PA, PC About Filament We use PLA filament. It’s less stinky than ABS, and in theory more environmentally friendly. The Bambu P1S printer supports other kinds of filament.  If you want to use a different kind of filament, let’s talk about it. Our filament costs about $30 per kilo, or $.03/g. ",
